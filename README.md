# Car_Slideshow_Slider


The Slideshow was built by using jQuery and it enables the users to play/pause/resume the slideshow animation.

At the bottom of the slideshow there is a slider. It is horizontal and has a single hangle that can be moved with the mouse. By default, the slider moves when slideshow moves.
